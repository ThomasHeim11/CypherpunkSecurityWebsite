## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Our CI/CD pipeline consists of three main workflows:

1. **🚀 Continuous Integration (CI)** - Runs on every push/PR
2. **🚀 Continuous Deployment (CD)** - Runs after successful CI
3. **🛡️ Security Scanning** - Runs daily and on security-relevant changes

## 🔄 Workflows

### 1. Continuous Integration (`ci.yml`)

**Triggers:**

- Push to `main`, `develop`, `feature/*`, `hotfix/*`
- Pull requests to `main`, `develop`
- Manual dispatch

**Jobs:**

- ✅ Pre-flight checks (skip duplicates)
- 📦 Dependency installation with caching
- 🔎 Code quality analysis (ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier)
- 🛡️ Security scanning (CodeQL, Snyk, NPM Audit)
- 🧪 Comprehensive testing (Unit, Integration)
- 🏗️ Build validation (Development & Production)
- 🚨 Lighthouse performance audit (PRs only)
- 🚪 Quality gate validation
- 📢 Notifications (Slack, GitHub)

### 2. Continuous Deployment (`cd.yml`)

**Triggers:**

- Successful CI workflow completion
- Manual dispatch with environment selection

**Jobs:**

- 🔍 Deployment validation
- 🚀 Staging deployment (develop branch)
- 🚀 Production deployment (main branch)
- 🧪 Post-deployment testing (E2E, Accessibility, Performance)
- 🔄 Automatic rollback on failure
- 📢 Deployment notifications

### 3. Security Scanning (`security.yml`)

**Triggers:**

- Daily schedule (2 AM UTC)
- Push to `main`, `develop`
- Pull requests to `main`
- Manual dispatch

**Jobs:**

- 🔍 Dependency vulnerability scanning
- 🔍 Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- 🔐 Secrets detection
- 🐳 Container security scanning
- 📜 License compliance checking
- 📊 Security reporting

## 🔐 Required Secrets

Configure these secrets in your GitHub repository settings:

### Deployment Secrets

```bash
NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN          # Netlify personal access token
NETLIFY_STAGING_SITE_ID     # Staging site ID from Netlify
NETLIFY_PRODUCTION_SITE_ID  # Production site ID from Netlify
```

### Security Scanning Secrets

```bash
SNYK_TOKEN                  # Snyk authentication token
SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN          # Semgrep security scanning token
SEMGREP_DEPLOYMENT_ID      # Semgrep deployment identifier
CODECOV_TOKEN              # CodeCov coverage reporting token
GITLEAKS_LICENSE           # GitLeaks pro license (optional)
```

### Notification Secrets

```bash
SLACK_WEBHOOK              # Slack webhook for notifications
```

## 🌿 Branch Strategy

Our branching strategy follows GitFlow principles:

- **`main`** - Production-ready code, deploys to production
- **`develop`** - Integration branch, deploys to staging
- **`feature/*`** - Feature development branches
- **`hotfix/*`** - Critical production fixes
- **`release/*`** - Release preparation branches

### Branch Protection Rules

Configure these rules for enterprise security:

#### Main Branch

- ✅ Require pull request reviews (1 minimum)
- ✅ Require status checks to pass
- ✅ Require up-to-date branches
- ✅ Include administrators
- ✅ Restrict pushes
- ✅ Require signed commits

#### Required Status Checks

- `🚪 Quality Gate`
- `🧪 Unit Tests`
- `🔗 Integration Tests`
- `🛡️ Security Scanning`
- `🏗️ Build Validation`

## 🚪 Quality Gates

All code must pass these quality gates:

### Code Quality

- ✅ ESLint: No errors, warnings allowed
- ✅ TypeScript: Strict compilation
- ✅ Prettier: Consistent formatting

### Testing

- ✅ Unit tests: 95% coverage minimum
- ✅ Integration tests: All pass
- ✅ No broken tests

### Security

- ✅ No high/critical vulnerabilities
- ✅ No secrets exposed
- ✅ License compliance

### Performance

- ✅ Lighthouse Performance: 85+
- ✅ Lighthouse Accessibility: 95+
- ✅ Bundle size: Within limits

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Automated Security Scanning

- **Dependency Scanning**: Daily Snyk and NPM audit
- **SAST**: CodeQL and Semgrep analysis
- **Secrets Detection**: TruffleHog and GitLeaks
- **Container Security**: Trivy scanning
- **License Compliance**: Automated license checking

### Security Policies

- No GPL/AGPL licenses allowed
- High/Critical vulnerabilities block deployment
- Secrets scanning on every commit
- Automated dependency updates via Dependabot

## 🚀 Deployment Process

### Staging Deployment

1. Push to `develop` branch
2. CI pipeline validates code
3. Automatic deployment to staging environment
4. Post-deployment smoke tests
5. Slack notification

### Production Deployment

1. Merge to `main` branch
2. CI pipeline validates code
3. Manual or automatic production deployment
4. Comprehensive health checks
5. Rollback on failure
6. Success/failure notifications

### Rollback Strategy

- Automatic rollback on deployment failure
- Manual rollback via GitHub Actions
- Previous version restoration
- Immediate alert notifications

## 📊 Monitoring & Alerts

### Notifications

- **Slack Integration**: Real-time status updates
- **GitHub Issues**: Automatic issue creation on failures
- **Email Alerts**: Critical security findings

### Monitoring Channels

- `#deployments` - Successful deployments
- `#alerts` - Failed deployments
- `#security-alerts` - Security findings
